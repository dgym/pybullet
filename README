About
=====
PyBullet is a Python wrapper of the Bullet Physics library.

Build
=====
Building PyBullet requires Bullet Physics headers and libraries.  If these are
in the default search path on your platform, then a simple distutils build
command should succeed:

    $ python setup.py build

If they are elsewhere, you can specify their location with the --include-dirs
and --library-dirs command line options:

    $ python setup.py build_ext --include-dirs /path/to/includes \
                                --library-dirs /path/to/libraries

Install
=======
You can install PyBullet using the normal distutils install command:

    $ python setup.py install

Documentation
=============
To learn how to use PyBullet, there are several resources available:

  - The Python API documentation for the bullet package
  - The programs in the PyBullet demos/ directory

PyBullet attempts to be a very thin wrapper around the Bullet Physics C++ API.
This means that much of the Bullet Physics documentation is useful in learning
and understanding PyBullet:

  - The Bullet Physics API documentation:

  - The Bullet Physics User Manual:
